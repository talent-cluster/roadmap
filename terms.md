Last updated: September 8, 2025

## 1. Acceptance of Terms

By accessing and using Talent Cluster's job page builder service, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms and provision of this agreement.

## 2. Service Description

Talent Cluster provides a job posting platform that allows users to create and publish job postings. Our service includes:

- Job posting creation and management
- Application collection and forwarding
- Email notifications for new applications to candidate and employer

## 3. Employer Responsibilities

We reserve the right to unpublish a job posting without reason and without refund if:

- it does not respond to applicants within 14 calendar days
- it does not provide information necessary for compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. Examples for USA/Canada Federal Contractor and subcontractors are "We are an Equal Opportunity Employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin.", "We maintain an Affirmative Action Program and seek to recruit, hire, and promote qualified individuals from diverse backgrounds", "We will not discharge or discriminate against employees or applicants for discussing or disclosing their own pay or the pay of another employee or applicant" and "Information about your rights as an applicant is available in our Equal Employment Opportunity and non-discrimination notice which is available upon request". An example for companies in Europe is having a link to their privacy policy for candidates.
- it does not provide accurate or any information about the company or the information provided is not verifiable. For example, no physical address or no company VAT information provided.
- it does not respect the rights of job applicants
- the job posting is for personal use
- you engage in misuse of our website. Misuse includes, but is not limited to, submitting unfounded reports of illegal content, submitting unfounded complaints, or posting illegal content.

These guidelines are designed to help employers and job seekers identify legitimate job postings and avoid scams. Adhering to these standards will create a safer and more trustworthy job board environment.

### 4. Acceptable Practices for Job Postings

While it might not be mandatory to state the compensation, time-commitment and remote work policy in your job posting, doing so can speedup your hiring process.

1. **Company Information**: Provide the company name and website or physical address. Avoid unverifiable company information like no website, no social media presence for the company and no physical address. Job postings from free email services (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo) without a corresponding company domain may raise red flags unless additional verification is provided.
2. **Clear Job Descriptions**: Include a detailed description of the role, responsibilities, and required qualifications. Specify the location of the job (remote, in-office, hybrid). Avoid vague job descriptions like a lack of specific details about job responsibilities or qualifications or use of generic titles without context.
3. **Salary Transparency**: Clearly state salary ranges or compensation packages when possible. Include information about benefits (healthcare, retirement plans, etc.). Avoid unrealistic salary with low requirements that seem too good to be true compared to industry standards.
4. **Application Process**: Outline all steps of the process and any required documents (cover letter, portfolio). Avoid asking candidates for sensitive personal information (e.g., Social Security number, bank account details) or asking applicants to send money before an interview or hiring process. Avoid using personal social media accounts, email addresses or phone numbers in the job description.
5. **Professional Language**: Use professional language that reflects the company’s brand. Avoid excessive jargon or vague terms. Avoid urging candidates to apply quickly or threatening them with limited-time offers. Avoid frequent grammatical mistakes or unprofessional language can indicate a lack of legitimacy. Avoid discriminatory, offensive, or inappropriate language.

## 5. Candidate Responsibilities

We reserve the right to prevent you from applying to any future job posting if:

- you responded after more than 14 calendar days in a previous job posting
- the email address you used in a previous job posting was invalid or belongs to someone else
- you applied to more than 21 job posting in 7 days
- you use more than one email addresses

## 6. Payment Terms

Payment is required in advance for all services. An invoice is available through Stripe.

## 7. Content Policy

Users may not post content that:

- Contains false or misleading information
- Infringes on intellectual property rights

## 8. Privacy

We collect and process personal information in accordance with our [Privacy Policy](/privacy). By using our service, you consent to the collection and use of information as described in our Privacy Policy.

## 9. Limitation of Liability

Talent Cluster shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses.
