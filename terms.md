These guidelines are designed to help employers and job seekers identify legitimate job postings and avoid scams. Adhering to these standards will create a safer and more trustworthy job board environment.

### 4. Acceptable Practices for Job Postings

1. **Company Information**: Provide the company name and website or physical address. Avoid unverifiable company information like no website, no social media presence for the company and no physical address. Job postings from free email services (e.g., Gmail, Yahoo) without a corresponding company domain may raise red flags unless additional verification is provided.
2. **Clear Job Descriptions**: Include a detailed description of the role, responsibilities, and required qualifications. Specify the location of the job (remote, in-office, hybrid). Avoid vague job descriptions like a lack of specific details about job responsibilities or qualifications or use of generic titles without context.
3. **Salary Transparency**: Clearly state salary ranges or compensation packages when possible. Include information about benefits (healthcare, retirement plans, etc.). Avoid unrealistic salary with low requirements that seem too good to be true compared to industry standards.
4. **Application Process**: Outline all steps of the process and any required documents (cover letter, portfolio). Avoid asking candidates for sensitive personal information (e.g., Social Security number, bank account details) or asking applicants to send money before an interview or hiring process. Avoid using personal social media accounts, email addresses or phone numbers in the job description.
5. **Professional Language**: Use professional language that reflects the companyâ€™s brand. Avoid excessive jargon or vague terms. Avoid urging candidates to apply quickly or threatening them with limited-time offers. Avoid frequent grammatical mistakes or unprofessional language can indicate a lack of legitimacy. Avoid discriminatory, offensive, or inappropriate language.

## 5. Payment Terms

Payment is required in advance for all services. An invoice is available through Stripe.

## 6. Content Policy

Users may not post content that:

- Contains false or misleading information
- Infringes on intellectual property rights

## 7. Privacy
